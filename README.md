This repository showcases a common error in Python: failing to close files properly after use. The `bug.py` file contains a function that opens a file but neglects to close it, while `bugSolution.py` presents a corrected version that addresses this issue using a context manager (`with` statement).  Unclosed files can result in resource exhaustion and unexpected behavior in your application. Always ensure you close your files after use to prevent these problems.
